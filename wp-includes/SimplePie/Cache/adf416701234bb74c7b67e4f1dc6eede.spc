Losing highly-qualified folks can be a huge hit and takes time to recover from. To prevent this, building employee engagement from the start may help prevent the loss of top-tier talent.</p>
<p>One easy way you can start growing employee engagement is by using an online learning program. Continuous, lifelong learning is a passion for many, and an inability to grow and learn in a position can be why employees jump ship.</p>
<p>Building an online learning program involves understanding employees&#8217; needs, offering diverse learning options, and personalizing the learning experience. Below, let&#8217;s explore some benefits of creating an online learning course before exploring how this solution could be implemented easily into your workforce.</p>
<h2>Benefits of using online learning for employee engagement</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Accessibility</b>. Ease of access to online courses eliminates the barrier of attending in-person classes. Now, employees can take online training and watch seminars from home, on breaks, or wherever. Combined with mobile training, online courses have the potential for company-wide acceptance due to ease of access.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b>. Provide options for interactive e-learning modules, webinars, virtual workshops, podcasts, or discussion forums. Offering diverse options ensures employees can engage with the content in ways that resonate with them.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Personalization</b>. Increase engagement by using an online learning platform that allows for a personalized learning path. Learning paths should be tailored to individual employee goals and career aspirations. By allowing employees to choose their learning journey at their own pace, you empower them to take ownership of their development, leading to higher engagement.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Gamification</b>. Introduce leaderboards, badges, or rewards for completing modules or achieving learning milestones to boost engagement. Gamification achievements can also help facilitate acknowledgment and celebration of employees&#8217; achievements. Celebrating progress boosts morale and motivates further learning.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Continuous learning</b>. Make sure your courses are not one-time only. Ongoing courses can provide growth opportunities, stimulate the intellect, promote self-motivation, and improve performance and innovation. When employees feel their organization invests in their development, they may feel motivated to contribute their best.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to promote engagement in online learning</h2>
<ol>
<li><b> Talk with employees about what learning opportunities they would find valuable</b>. Having this conversation is also a way to learn more about your team&#8217;s self-perceived strengths and weaknesses. For example, an employee who is keen to take leadership courses may help you discover a person who is ready to move into a management role.</li>
<li><b> Make time for your employees to pursue online courses.</b> Consider offering a certain number of paid hours for ongoing education quarterly. Let employees decide when to use those hours to build learning paths that fit their schedules.</li>
<li><b> Create support materials to improve employee training. </b>Think of your onboarding training in stages, with new employees receiving the next stage in their training after they&#8217;ve had a few months to master the basics. Offering these courses through an online platform means they&#8217;re also available for employees to review at any time.</li>
<li><b> Encourage employees to create and share their own courses. </b>Many employees will jump at the chance to share their own training or expertise. especially if their audience is eager to learn what they have to offer. Designing a course has its own professional development benefits by allowing the employee to review their knowledge and think about how best to present it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Boost Engagement with LearnDash</h2>
<p>Giving employees the support to improve their skillset through online courses is a relatively low-cost investment with the potential for huge returns. If you show your employees that you believe in their excellence and ongoing development, few of them will choose to take their skills elsewhere.</p>

<p>Corporate learning is a crucial part of any organization&#8217;s strategy for growth and success. Corporate learning helps your workforce acquire and develop the skills, knowledge, and competencies they need to be successful. A more skilled and engaged workforce can lead to increased innovation, productivity, and adaptability.</p>



<p>Each year, companies make huge investments in the latest trends and technology to keep their workers trained and agile. Last year, it was reported that US companies <a href="https://learnexperts.ai/blog/how-much-do-companies-spend-on-training-per-employee/#:~:text=Training%20Costs%20per%20Employee%20in%20U.S.&amp;text=Large%20companies%20spent%20an%20average,to%20a%20134%20percent%20increase.">spent</a> an average of $1,689 per learner in training costs. In addition, as much as 18% of that training was conducted via <a href="https://www.litmos.com/blog/mobile-learning/mobile-statistics-means-corporate-training">mobile devices</a>, with that number rising each year.</p>



<p>Keep up with training demands by implementing some of the top corporate learning trends below.</p>



<h2 id="h-emerging-trends-in-corporate-learning">Emerging trends in corporate learning</h2>



<ul>
<li><b>Personalized learning</b>. Creating a more personalized learning experience has great potential to engage your users in your corporate training course. Personalized learning means to pace the course to the learner&#8217;s unique needs and learning preferences. This means that the objectives, delivery, and method of instruction may vary. One of the best ways to implement personalized learning is by creating a learning path. A learning path can be created by introducing a short quiz at the start of the lesson and, depending on the outcome, directing the learner towards a certain set of lessons to complete. This can create just the right challenge in your training program to keep your learner engaged and interested.</li>



<li><b>Microlearning</b>.&nbsp; With attention spans becoming shorter and shorter, online training has had to adapt to meet users where they are. However, this doesn&#8217;t have to be a bad thing. In fact, microlearning &#8211; quick lessons hyperfocused on one singular topic &#8211; have<a href="https://www.learndash.com/use-microlearning-to-create-a-better-mobile-learning-experience/"> proven results</a> in retention and engagement. The key here is to chunk topics into meaningful segments and to quiz or test the learner in some way by the end of the lesson. Ideally, the lessons should build upon one another, whereas a corporate training course is actually completed in ten to fifteen mini-lessons, rather than one or two long units.</li>



<li><b>Gamification</b>. Gamification elements such as forums, activity streams, badges, leaderboards, and progress bars can be used to support engagement in training material. It’s proven that adding simple gaming elements can help keep learners engaged and achieve <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-gamification-helps-learners-achieve-flow/">flow</a>, where learners are neither bored nor anxious while learning. Gamification is being seen more and more in training courses, especially as technology allows for more immersive experiences.</li>



<li><b>Virtual reality and augmented reality</b> &#8211; What if you could use virtual and augmented reality to help your learners identify actual concerns and issues in the workforce? For example, employees could use an <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-to-use-augmented-reality-in-the-classroom/">augmented reality simulation</a> to draw attention to workplace danger zones, learn new equipment, and even<a href="https://trainingmag.com/how-augmented-reality-is-changing-the-training-industry/#:~:text=Many%20global%20companies%20and%20large,done%20a%20lot%20of%20things."> review diseases</a> in medical workplaces. This is an emerging technology that global companies and large corporations have been investing in heavily over the last few years and is becoming more commonplace.</li>



<li><b>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</b>. One way to enhance corporate pieces of training is to take advantage of machine learning. <a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-ways-machine-learning-can-improve-online-education/">Machine learning</a> is a form of artificial intelligence that helps computer systems analyze data sets while performing certain tasks, and then gradually improve performance based on that data feedback without the need for further programming. This means that your automated tasks actually change and improve based on how a user interacts with them. This can be used to create personalized feedback or automate tasks based on a learner&#8217;s performance in a training course. A lot of attention has been paid recently to how AI improves routine tasks, and it looks like this trend is here to say for the foreseeable future.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-support-new-corporate-learning">How to Support New Corporate Learning</h2>



<p>When integrating trends and new learning methods in your corporate training program, there are two main ways you can continue to support these efforts: through data and analytics, and through social learning.</p>



<p><b>Data and Analytics</b></p>



<p>While implementing new corporate training tactics like those above, it&#8217;s important to use data to track learner progress and engagement. Predictive analytics can help identify potential roadblocks in learning.</p>



<p>Your needs assessment should indicate what the intended outcome of training is. Whether it&#8217;s a reduction in customer service complaints, higher employee satisfaction scores, or lower scrap and rework costs on the factory floor, having a measure for success can validate the project, or show ways in which it might be improved.</p>



<p><b>Social learning</b></p>



<p>For the most part, people like to interact with others. They want to be part of a community and feel like what they are learning matters in a practical sense. Incorporate social media and collaboration tools in corporate learning to create a collaborative feel. Peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing can help provide that sense of community and make training less tedious.</p>



<p>Community and engagement are a huge part of online learning. Encouraging your learners to connect with other learners increases the value of your course and gives learners more reason to stay around. It also takes some of the pressure off you to be constantly creating new content.</p>



<h2 id="h-stay-competitive-with-continuous-learning">Stay Competitive with Continuous Learning</h2>



<p>With rapid changes in technology and industry demands, there is a need for continuous learning and upskilling. Continuous learning and upskilling your employees will help you maintain a competitive edge above the competition. It&#8217;ll also&nbsp;ensure that employees are up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies, which is essential for growth.</p>

<p>In the last decade, mobile learning has been a huge breakthrough for online education. Mobile learning takes your coursework off a computer screen so students can access the material via tablet or smartphone anytime.</p>



<p>The portability and convenience of mobile learning has numerous benefits, especially if you’re looking for ways to enhance your employee training. Combining employee training with mobile learning lets employees access courses when and where it is convenient for them, making them much more likely to tackle and finish training courses.</p>



<p>Increasing your employee training completion rates can build their confidence, help achieve workplace goals, and ensure employees have the resources they need.</p>



<p>Below, let’s dive into some specifics on why we think mobile learning is the future of employee training.</p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-mobile-learning-for-employee-training">Benefits of mobile learning for employee training</h2>



<h3 id="h-flexibility-and-convenience">Flexibility and convenience</h3>



<p>The flexibility and convenience of mobile learning is <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-reasons-mobile-learning-rocks/">unparalleled</a>. Not every learner has access to a computer at work or during conventional working hours. Employees who aren’t at a desk may not be able to access training at all unless it is mobile. Mobile training can be accessed whether an employee works in manufacturing, transportation, retail, or other service industries. Material can be completed at home, on the bus, during breaks, or whenever.</p>



<p>It may seem like a negative at first for training materials to be consumed in these small chunks of time, but <a href="https://www.learndash.com/top-7-e-learning-challenges-for-instructional-designers/">research</a> suggests otherwise. In fact, most learners retain information longer when digesting it in small chunks. All this makes mobile training ideal for employers looking for effective ways to keep employees up to date.</p>



<h3 id="h-increased-engagement-and-motivation">Increased engagement and motivation</h3>



<p>In addition, being able to take trainings on the go in small chunks can keep learners engaged and motivated. This is especially true if your employee training program makes use of video content. Since<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/more-than-3-5-youtube-video-views-occur-on-mobile-devices#"> 3 out 5 YouTube videos are watched on mobile</a>, you can bet your employees would much rather watch that video on their mobile device than sitting at a computer screen. Combine a video strategy with mobile learning, and see how engagement and motivation may rise as a result.</p>



<h3 id="h-cost-effective-and-time-efficient">Cost-effective and time-efficient</h3>



<p>Mobile employee training courses are perfect for <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-micro-learning-in-your-course/">microtraining</a>, which are short lessons that learners can experience or review a bit at a time. This allows you to break up skills into subskills for a deeper understanding of each concept. For example, a training on safety hazards can be several microtrainings covering one specific area of the workplace per training. This can save time and money on retraining employees down the line. Microtraining also negates the need for filler material between topics, which is cost and time efficient for those who are building employee training programs.</p>



<h3 id="h-personalized-learning-experience">Personalized learning experience</h3>



<p>As we’ve discussed before,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-major-learning-styles-which-one-is-you/">learning styles are largely a myth</a>. However, learners certainly have a preference in how they prefer their content. Mobile learning lets you create content to appeal to learners of all backgrounds and preferences. For example, short videos, interactive games, and check-in quizzes are all perfect for mobile and can feel like they were personally tailored for how learners prefer to engage with their mobile devices. The only thing you need to be prepared to do is rigorously test the materials on a phone or tablet to ensure they function correctly.</p>



<h3 id="h-real-time-feedback-and-assessment">Real-time feedback and assessment</h3>



<p>Mobile training can take advantage of several features that we have grown accustomed to on mobile devices, such as notifications and chats. For example, enabling a forum or chat room for learners to ask questions both with the instructor and other classmates can provide a real-time assessment of their learning. The way we constantly check our devices when a notification pops up can be used to a trainer’s advantage to nudge students to check feedback or finish an assignment by the due date.</p>



<h2 id="h-learndash-the-ultimate-lms-solution-for-mobile-learning">LearnDash: The ultimate LMS solution for mobile learning</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to implement a mobile learning solution for your employee training, you’ll first need to make sure that the LMS software chosen is well suited for mobile learning.</p>



<p>While there are a variety of LMS software <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/lms/mobile-lms-comparison/">equipped with mobile learning capabilities</a>, we think LearnDash provides the most flexibility for your mobile training, which is super important when <a href="https://www.hurix.com/10-reasons-need-mobile-lms/#:~:text=A%20mobile%20LMS%20gives%20users,devices%20for%20training%20and%20learning.">choosing</a> the right LMS software with mobile learning capabilities.

<p>Nearly every industry depends on employee training programs to onboard new hires. Trainings can also keep staff up-to-date on job duties, protocols, and industry trends.</p>



<p>For many companies, an effective employee training program isn’t just a “nice-to-have.” Your program could be a tool for communicating safety and compliance standards that keep your employees safe and protect your company from liability.</p>



<p>So, how do you measure the effectiveness of a training program? There are several ways you can do it (and—spoiler—there’s one way that ranks above the rest).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, we’ll walk through some of the most common methods to measure training program effectiveness. For each method, we’ll break down the pros and cons. Then we’ll share the single best way to measure the value of your own employee training program.</p>



<h2 id="h-traditional-methods-for-evaluating-training-programs">Traditional methods for evaluating training programs</h2>



<p>These are the tried-and-true methods that many companies rely on to evaluate their employee training programs. They include:</p>



<h3 id="h-self-reported-surveys-and-feedback-forms">Self-reported surveys and feedback forms</h3>



<p>Employees complete a survey or feedback form after they finish training. This can provide useful insight into the employee experience. This feedback can also be helpful as you make adjustments to your training program in the future. This method has its limits, though: It only takes into account the employee’s perspective on the training experience.</p>



<h3 id="h-pre-and-post-training-assessments">Pre- and post-training assessments</h3>



<p>These assessments help you measure an employee’s understanding of the material before and after a training. Although assessments measure retention, they may not be a good indicator of an employee’s true comprehension. Many assessments screen for understanding of basic concepts, but they can’t predict whether concepts will be put into practice on the job site.</p>



<h3 id="h-observation-and-feedback-from-managers">Observation and feedback from managers</h3>



<p>Manager feedback is an important way to evaluate any training program. Managers provide first-hand accounts of employee performance. They can tell whether employees are adhering to guidelines spelled out in training.</p>



<p>However, manager feedback is subjective and can’t offer a holistic view of your training’s effectiveness. It’s also time-consuming to regularly check in with managers for individual feedback on each employee.</p>



<h2 id="h-limitations-of-traditional-methods">Limitations of traditional methods</h2>



<p>In addition to the limitations laid out above, each of these methods is subject to bias and subjectivity—especially those that rely on individual feedback.</p>



<p>Plus, none of the traditional methods offer a simple way to measure the long-term impact of your training program. You might be able to measure initial retention, but these methods don’t go deep enough to identify behavioral change.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-better-way-to-evaluate-trainings">A better way to evaluate trainings</h2>



<p>The best way to evaluate your employee training program is with the help of a learning management system (LMS).</p>



<p>An LMS empowers you with the tools to create objective, standardized evaluations. Plus, you can take advantage of real-time progress tracking to see where employees are in the training. This also lets you identify common points of confusion in your program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of administering a single assessment at the end of the program, you can easily weave quizzes and assessments throughout a training to evaluate incremental progress. You can also use other LMS tools to evaluate progress, including surveys and open-response forms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A powerful LMS gives you the flexibility to create custom evaluations that fit your program. It’s easy to collect data in one dashboard, rather than tracking individual surveys, assessments, and feedback forms.</p>



<p>Ultimately, an LMS can help you stay organized and measure the long-term impact of your program through multiple centralized evaluation methods.</p>

<p>Creating an effective elearning program for your organization can be a daunting task, but with the right instructional process, it doesn&#8217;t have to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of instructional design is to create engaging and effective learning experiences that help learners acquire knowledge and skills efficiently and effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process for developing online training courses varies between organizations. Some organizations use a linear approach, while others prefer an iterative process.</p>



<p>No matter which approach an organization follows, there are a few steps that remain mandatory in every instructional design process. Understanding the purpose of each step will help you achieve the desired output at every step, irrespective of your approach.</p>



<p>Following the 9-step instructional process below, you can create an effective elearning program that engages learners and achieves learning objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-1-analyze-the-audience">1. Analyze the audience</h2>



<p>Before you start designing your course, it&#8217;s important to analyze your audience. Who are they? What do they already know? What do they need to learn? Knowing this information will help you design a course tailored to their needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-define-the-learning-objectives">2. Define the learning objectives</h2>



<p>Once you understand your audience, it&#8217;s time to define the learning objectives. What do you want your learners to be able to do after completing the course? Make sure your objectives are specific, measurable, and achievable.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-develop-assessments">3. Develop assessments</h2>



<p>Assessments are an important part of e-learning. They help learners measure their understanding and help instructors evaluate the effectiveness of the course. Develop assessments that align with your learning objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-design-the-course-content">4. Design the course content</h2>



<p>With your learning objectives and assessments in mind, it&#8217;s time to design the course content. Create content that is engaging, interactive, and relevant to your learners.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-create-multimedia-materials">5. Create multimedia materials</h2>



<p>Incorporate multimedia materials such as videos, images, and audio to enhance the learning experience. Make sure your materials are high-quality and add value to the course.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-develop-the-course-structure">6. Develop the course structure</h2>



<p>Organize your course content into a logical structure that is easy to follow. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up large blocks of text.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-deliver-the-course">7. Deliver the course</h2>



<p>Choose a delivery method that is appropriate for your learners. Will they complete the course online, in person, or a combination of both? Make sure your delivery method aligns with your learning objectives and assessments.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-evaluate-the-course">8. Evaluate the course</h2>



<p>After the course is delivered, it&#8217;s important to evaluate its effectiveness. Use feedback from learners and instructors to identify areas for improvement.</p>



<h2 id="h-9-revise-and-improve-the-course">9. Revise and improve the course</h2>



<p>Based on the evaluation feedback, revise and improve the course content, assessments, and delivery method to make the course even better.</p>



<p>In addition to the steps outlined above, there are some other important considerations to keep in mind when developing an e-learning program. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few of them:</p>



<h3 id="h-use-adult-learning-principles">Use adult learning principles</h3>



<p>Adult learners have unique needs and preferences when it comes to learning. They want to know why they are learning something, they want to be able to apply it in their lives, and they want to be engaged in the learning process. Make sure your e-learning program takes these principles into account.</p>



<h3 id="h-make-it-accessible">Make it accessible</h3>



<p>Accessibility is an important consideration when designing e-learning. Ensure your program is accessible to learners with disabilities, such as those who are visually or hearing impaired. This may mean providing transcripts or captions for videos or ensuring that the program can be navigated using a keyboard.</p>



<h3 id="h-consider-mobile-devices">Consider mobile devices</h3>



<p>More and more people are accessing e-learning programs on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Make sure your program is optimized for mobile devices, with a responsive design that allows learners to access it on any device.</p>



<h3 id="h-incorporate-social-learning">Incorporate social learning</h3>



<p>Social learning is an effective way to engage learners and help them apply what they have learned. Incorporate opportunities for learners to collaborate with each other, share ideas, and provide feedback.</p>



<h3 id="h-make-it-fun">Make it fun</h3>



<p>Learning doesn&#8217;t have to be dry and boring. Incorporate gamification elements into your e-learning program, such as quizzes, badges, and leaderboards, to make it more engaging and enjoyable for learners.</p>



<p>By keeping these considerations in mind, you can create an elearning program that is engaging, effective, and accessible to all learners. So why not give it a try?

<p>Years ago, elearning was a novelty in the world of higher education. But these days, more colleges and universities than ever are offering online courses and virtual degree-granting programs.</p>



<p>Wondering if it’s time to embrace elearning in your own higher-ed setting? Here are several reasons it’s essential, both for students and for educators.</p>



<h2 id="h-elearning-benefits-for-learners">Elearning Benefits for Learners</h2>



<p>Today’s students favor online learning for numerous reasons. These are a few of the most vital:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility. </strong>Just as remote workers have embraced the flexibility of virtual workplaces, many students expect the same level of flexibility from their education. A majority of students opt for remote education specifically to avoid going to campus, according to <a href="https://universityservices.wiley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/202209-VOL2022-report-WUNI_Final_Update.pdf">a national survey from Wiley Educational Services</a>; nearly 70 percent of respondents said they prefer asynchronous programs. This format gives students the option to study at their own pace and complete courses on their own schedule.</li>



<li><strong>Personalization</strong>. For some students, elearning can provide a personalized approach to education that might not be possible to achieve in a traditional classroom. By customizing their courses and curating their own curriculum, learners can focus on areas where they need the most support.</li>



<li><strong>Access</strong>. By offering your students the ability to study from anywhere with an internet connection, you can provide greater access to education. This can be especially impactful in remote locations or areas without nearby access to college-level courses.</li>



<li><strong>Multimedia</strong>. Elearning also provides a unique opportunity to engage learners with multimedia content such as videos, animations, and simulations. This content not only keeps virtual learners engaged but can also enhance retention of course material.</li>



<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>. With online learning, students can take advantage of opportunities to collaborate and interact with their peers and instructors through online forums and discussion boards. This can help foster a sense of community and support among learners as they build relationships through the screen.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-elearning-benefits-for-educators">Elearning Benefits for Educators</h2>



<p>Both educators and students stand to benefit from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-online-learning-is-vital-to-education/">online learning in higher education</a>. Here are some of the pros of elearning from an educator’s perspective:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Increased engagement. </strong>While it’s true that distance learning comes with <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED610374.pdf">some challenges</a>, elearning can also provide <em>more</em> opportunities for instructors to create engaging, interactive learning experiences. With interactive quizzes and assessments, gamification, and other multimedia, educators can take advantage of online learning to increase student engagement.</li>



<li><strong>Flexibility. </strong>It isn’t just a benefit for students: Educators can also enjoy more flexibility in how they deliver lessons. Creating and sharing course material online allows you to easily customize lessons to suit individual students’ needs and preferences.</li>



<li><strong>Data analytics. </strong>For many educators, elearning has enhanced the ability to track student progress and performance. With a powerful learning management system, you can monitor students throughout your courses and identify areas where students need more support or resources. The learnings you glean can also help you improve your courses from session to session.</li>



<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>. Forget last-minute trips to the copy room. By embracing elearning, educators can create and share course materials online and reduce the need for textbooks and paper handouts. Streamlining your teaching process lets you focus on high-quality instruction and keeping students engaged.</li>



<li><strong>Professional development. </strong>Instructors aren’t just teaching their own courses online—they’re also brushing up on their own skills and seeking professional development opportunities for themselves. As an instructor, you can enroll in virtual courses to help you expand your skills and follow the latest trends and best practices in your field.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-take-the-step-to-online-learning-in-your-own-classroom">Take the step to online learning in your own classroom</h2>



<p>Today’s students expect flexible online learning options, and educators can also benefit from the power and efficiency of elearning.&nbsp;</p>

The platform has over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats">2.6 billion users worldwide</a>, and you can tap into this never-ending source of traffic to increase subscribers to your channel.</h1>



<p>As a course creator, more subscribers means more leads and a boost in the passive income generated through your elearning platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to be successful, you must have an effective strategy. With that in mind, here are the seven steps to start a YouTube channel to complement your online courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-1-use-free-content-to-introduce-new-leads-to-your-brand">1. Use Free Content to Introduce New Leads to Your Brand</h2>



<p>Creating valuable free content is one of the best ways to stand out when promoting your online course on YouTube. You can offer videos and tutorials as a way to introduce new leads to your brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you prove your value by uploading new content regularly, it simplifies the process of transforming your audience from free YouTube viewers to paying students.&nbsp; Viewers will be so impressed with your free material that they’ll start to wonder about the value they might get with your premium course.</p>



<p>A great way to use this marketing tactic is to <strong>publish free mini-courses</strong> on your channel. This helps familiarize students with your teaching style and build better relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, it’s a great way to sell naturally. At the end of your free course, you can invite learners to check out your premium course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to creating free content for your channel, you can also <strong>give away a premium lesson </strong>for free. This is probably the best way to prove to your audience that they will find real value in your course. Just make sure this is a lesson that can work well as a standalone video.</p>



<p>Publish the lesson on your channel and add the link to your homepage. If you have a newsletter, add the link there so subscribers can check out your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-create-a-channel-trailer-to-attract-interest">2. Create a Channel Trailer to Attract Interest</h2>



<p>It’s smart to include some marketing in your video content, and a great way to do this is by creating a <a href="https://www.veedyou.com/9-tips-for-epic-youtube-channel-trailers/">YouTube channel trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trailer videos are great for grabbing your audience’s interest. You can use them to help prospective students imagine different ways they could change their life or business with your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By showing them what’s possible, you make it a lot more likely that they will want to sign up for your course.</p>



<p>You can use a tool like Animaker’s all-in-one trailer maker to produce a gripping trailer for your channel.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UA6vqZBKXOtRVwFC7Fx_4T5iuDbsV28FvSZA3AwIlQYUFfjFpGRlbtOP3ydi4oMGWiBwh1fNn0EOAwJJu6VCRfqvq6CI-ZTRJoNa932G2upO0x8W2kd1ptnt60EyGuqdd2TW7ErQF09l5q-DMUsvDTU" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.animaker.com/trailer-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></p>



<p>Create a trailer video that points your audience toward your online course <em>or </em>lead magnet. Post this as your channel’s trailer. Since it has a prominent place on your home page, it will help you get more people to check out your course or lead magnet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your online course isn’t the only focus of your channel, then you can include it as an aside after your main video footage. </p>



<p>Either way, make sure you include a strong call to action (CTA) at the end of your video trailer. This is essential to get your viewers to take some kind of action, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing your online course</li>



<li><a href="https://wpastra.com/blogging/how-to-build-an-email-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joining your email list</a></li>



<li>Becoming part of your online community</li>



<li>Subscribing to your YouTube channel</li>



<li>Connecting with you on other platforms</li>
</ul>



<p>…and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just remember to use one CTA at a time to avoid confusing your viewers. Though different, each CTA works effectively, and you must choose the one that’s relevant to your goals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-incentivize-viewers-to-purchase-your-course">3. Incentivize Viewers to Purchase Your Course</h2>



<p>As the second-largest search engine in the world, YouTube is already attracting millions of viewers who are looking for the type of information you provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s up to you to give them a good enough reason why <em>your </em>online course may be the ideal solution to their problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can do this in a number of ways. Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Create teasers:</strong> Create short videos with sneak peeks and helpful tips to incentivize viewers to purchase your online course or subscribe to a series. This type of content helps increase the buzz around your course and can generate more leads and sales.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Livestream R=regularly: </strong>Expert marketers will tell you that the best way to sell to anyone is through a live one-on-one conversation. The second-best way is a video call. It’s obvious why this is so true; talking to someone directly is a lot more powerful than posting on social media or sending an email through your <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email marketing platform</a>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Talk to your audience about their problems and answer their questions. Position your course as the ideal solution to help them achieve their goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Build a community:</strong> YouTube has a feature that makes it easy for creators to build a community around their topic. You can use non-video content here, such as stories and shorts, to engage your audience and reach even more people who are interested in your course. </li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t forget to add a compelling call to action to your videos. And make it easy for your viewers to take the next step toward purchasing your course or subscribing to a series, which gives you even more opportunities to convert viewers into customers (more on that below).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-get-subscribers-to-your-youtube-channel">4. Get Subscribers to Your YouTube Channel</h2>



<p>It’s tempting to want to include a link that goes directly to your online course sales page. But when dealing with your YouTube audience, it’s a lot easier to start small and offer them a lead magnet instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although your end goal is to sell your course, make it your <em>immediate </em>goal to collect your viewers’ email addresses from your YouTube channel. This will allow you to stay connected to them so you can navigate them toward the ultimate goal of purchasing your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many businesses rely on email as a cost-effective way to acquire new customers and leads. With an average return on investment of <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$36 for each dollar spent</a> it’s not hard to see why. </p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/email-collection-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start collecting emails</a>, include a link to your lead magnet wherever you can. For instance, you can add a link to </p>



<ul>
<li>Your video description</li>



<li>End screen</li>



<li>Annotations&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cards, etc.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you have your lead magnet and updated links pointing to your opt-in page, you’ll be able to start collecting your viewers’ email addresses. After you complete the process, it’s worth using an <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/verify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email verification tool</a> to verify email addresses and keep your email list clean.</p>



<p>From there, you can start building and nurturing your relationship with customers via email and warm them up to purchasing your course.</p>



<p>Check out this example of how entrepreneur Elna Cain includes a link to her lead magnet (Free Business Plan) on her channel’s main header links.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zdp8bueNnsEg02pSrq4zlIDdZyxzfq14hB28vRF47sjC9yyw1_0YZSBp_000bX_b1JJjzSTdvxraEJAHybpx3tl1LW9UkV7um3VYff7LsYdXZiMVq9FyU1AhX01NqoVYjGjhZk3vvL-wkuFCm5bxyOI" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElnaWrites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></p>



<p>She also includes it in her description below the published video. In fact, she makes sure to include links to her lead magnet wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-5-cross-share-content-across-multiple-media-channels">5. Cross-Share Content Across Multiple Media Channels</h2>



<p>The videos you create for your YouTube channel can be cross-shared across social media channels and email newsletters to promote your new online course. You can also embed them into course landing pages or even start a blog that will complement your efforts. Plus, don’t neglect to repurpose YouTube videos as YouTube Shorts or native social media videos and turn them into new podcast episodes, blogs, and social media posts, and so on.</p>



<p>Just remember, although the goal is to make sales, it’s not a good idea to sell on every video. This won’t help you build a good relationship with your subscribers and fans across different platforms. Focus on creating content that educates and entertains. Tutorials, reviews, and customer stories are great options too. This builds a better connection with your followers and establishes trust.</p>



<p>You need to first show them that you have value to offer; then, they will trust you when you offer your premium course to help them solve their problems or achieve their goals. </p>



<p>So, when cross-sharing your content, make sure it’s a healthy mix of educational, personal, and promotional content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few tips on how you might incorporate utilized these content pillars into your marketing strategy: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Educational Content: </strong>Share helpful videos that educate your viewers for free. Don’t forget to include a call to action to like, subscribe, share, comment, or check out more videos on your channel. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Stories: </strong>You can share personal stories to help build deeper relationships with your audience. Showing your authentic self helps makes it easier to build credibility and trust. Include a CTA at the end of your video for viewers to join your email list or online community. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Promotional Videos:</strong> These are videos that you create specifically to promote your online courses, such as teasers and trailers. At the end of each, make sure to include a strong CTA to check out your premium course. </li>
</ul>



<p>You can increase your promotional activities on special days. For example, you can use coupons and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-course-creators-can-take-advantage-of-black-friday-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discount offers on special occasions</a>, like Black Friday, Thanksgiving, etc. This will help you get even more eyeballs to your content. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-include-testimonial-videos-as-social-proof">6. Include Testimonial Videos as Social Proof</h2>



<p>Featuring testimonials in your videos can be pivotal in helping you sell your online course on your YouTube channel. According to recent stats, <a href="https://boast.io/20-statistics-about-using-testimonials-in-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">72% of customers</a> claim that positive testimonials and reviews enhance their trust in a brand. </p>



<p>Look for past clients or beta students who can leave positive reviews about their experience with going through your course. </p>



<p>Videographer Kevin Shen uses this tactic effectively to showcase positive testimonials from his past students.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dwKbwjghfPZeAqUJz7WdkNmQPeoXpL-3ES7INwNUnR45O3dyaYf0sB00RgDWRDVyODDJeiCw8WObYAc6LCA4F-x5gC--BwTSrqaJy8ZnCOk-28xXd-V2DHJ2IxCsm69Rw2yA2Ke6M9NmAASayMNKjhc" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzeWaXPghmjXZaC673XD4tA">Source</a></p>



<p>These types of reviews from authentic customers can work wonders in helping you build authority and <a href="https://startup.unitelvoice.com/build-brand-trust">trust in your brand</a>. They also play a huge role in influencing customers’ purchasing decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure your testimonials provide answers to questions from your target students.</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>What made you choose this online course over others?&nbsp;</li>



<li>What was the main problem you had that made you want to start this course?&nbsp;</li>



<li>How has the course impacted your life/business?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Include real stories told by happy and satisfied clients to help you build trust with your YouTube audience <em>and </em>show potential clients that you can deliver results.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-use-youtube-ads-as-an-independent-revenue-channel">7. Use YouTube Ads as an Independent Revenue Channel&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many ways to monetize your YouTube channel and make money from your creative work. YouTube ads are among the most common channel monetization methods.</p>



<p>You can turn your YouTube channel into an independent revenue source once your traffic reaches a certain threshold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can get access to YouTube’s monetization features once your channel meets the following requirements:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>More than 4,000 valid public watch hours in the past 12 months</li>



<li>More than 1,000 subscribers to your channel</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you hit those thresholds, you’ll be able to sign up for YouTube’s partner program and monetize your channel. This is an easy way to add an extra passive income stream to your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the best part? Once you become a YouTube Partner, many other earning opportunities open up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to video ads, you also get access to YouTube Premium subscription fees, channel memberships, Super Chat, and other features that give you a direct line to your fans’ wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-bonus-tip-leverage-youtube-seo">Bonus Tip: Leverage YouTube SEO</h2>



<p>When creating free content to promote your course on your YouTube channel, make sure to optimize each video for SEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>YouTube is the second largest search engine, and it offers creators a reliable way to grow organically—but only if you leverage YouTube SEO. You must use this to your advantage to get as many people to see your content as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the things you can do to optimize your content for SEO include the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Video title:</strong> Come up with a relevant title that your ideal students would naturally search.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Video description:</strong> Write a concise description that gives a clear overview of your video. Include any keywords your audience might search to discover related content.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Video tags: </strong>Add as many related tags as you can. This will further enhance the chances of each video showing up in search.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Thumbnail image:</strong> Great video thumbnails entice people to click through to watch your video. Make sure each video you upload has a relevant thumbnail that will make your viewers excited to click on it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this guide has helped you understand how you can use your YouTube channel to complement your online course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our featured customer this month is <a href="https://thedancedojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dance Dojo</a>: Online Salsa and Bachata courses that help teach beginners how to dance like a pro. </p>



<p>The Dance Dojo is the most popular salsa dance course on the internet. Instead of focusing on teaching complex patterns like most instructors, they’ve broken down the learning process into tiny steps that focus on learning individual moves, foundations, and technique.</p>



<p>The courses are easy to digest, go step by step, and help anyone develop strong foundations to build on. Their courses are for anyone who wants to learn to salsa dance and go out &#8220;social dancing&#8221; at parties, to meet new people, and develop a sense of community.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the Dance Dojo has seen over 3,800 students from 68 countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore how The Dance Dojo uses LearnDash to power its successful online dance courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-two-immersive-courses">Two Immersive Courses</h2>



<p>On the home page, you’ll see the option to get started right away learning either salsa or Bachata from skilled professionals. The landing page copy addresses common concerns many have found with free content on YouTube. They aim to solve those pain points with a dedicated course structure that includes theory as well as instruction. The call to action to “get started for free” compels users to try out the courses.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Arvr2AfPEDTebNOlTXFCt4ZUcOgdeCab0YfO-FKF9r4MnKexTJ91u6c67xPcF1XjOoI-rcuGT30ygERTyG4Sx_YsjjP9YrjRyjHJmUvabD9Y9Cu5WbQrAT2akiTfo9fwpBp2GjcDpheTTyiE2lHT2C8" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When you click “Get Started for free,” a new page explains how to access a free week of classes. This is made possible using LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-access/">Course Access</a> settings. This is built right into the course editor and allows you to control when and how folks access your courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To set a free trial, navigate to Settings and scroll down to “Course Access Expiration.” Toggle on the button and set the length of your free trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all! LearnDash will now grant access to the course for the specified number of days, starting on the user’s enrollment date. LearnDash also gives you a Data Deletion option, so you can choose to either store or erase a registrant’s course data after their access has expired.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8yWbMBYij_7sOXk8vRzU6ZuD34TPzlpqUoLH6YhdHRhgINN5APqq4Olqf4gfB1bCpP0xHzUTP2e3Zr_Cer239Bld1PSg5aOqtBYCGH8B_lqExctDL7XXep1rDRI-epoe_5m0UAtYuMJXNHgscdQnxmY" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-robust-lessons">Robust Lessons</h2>



<p>Once in a course, you’ll see just how thorough these lessons are. They break down not only how to perform the movements but also the challenges dancers may face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in a lesson, you’ll see your course navigation on the left, with the lesson content on the right, so you never lose your place. You’ll see that Dance Dojo makes well-organized use of LearnDash’s Lessons and Topics features to break down the concepts in an easy-to-follow manner. Vimeo videos are embedded right into lessons – in fact, you can create an entire course in minutes by simply uploading a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXCctTk320s">Vimeo playlist.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>LearnDash also allows you to add multiple topics to a single page, so your learners can jump in between videos to remember previous steps without loading new pages. Once finished, learners can mark the lesson as complete to track their progress. The Module Progress bar at the top also helps learners stay focused on completing the lesson and adds a small bit of gamification to see that the progress bar is filled in 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oAfelK-mMQ0zU_YywHe7w7IvS5fLSDC7XmJ8HmJPCy6wVtnyGk5RQHC4Wl3liAT17lhom9-4ywV6lv0tXWxK9Af_PGNQud7WrjeQki5XfB2L8_ne7sG5-WHkMdRiw15q7SLDBL2LnoKwHbDyQ2QwXUA" alt=""/></figure>

<p>“Using LearnDash allowed us to stick with WordPress and have the flexibility to design the UX how we wanted it. In Kajabi for example, you can&#8217;t place more than one video in a lesson. It just didn&#8217;t quite fit our existing structure. LearnDash is a good-looking LMS that you can plugin to WordPress that&#8217;s flexible enough for any knowledge/info/course business.”</p>

<p>The role of an instructional designer is critical in creating successful learning experiences. Instructional designers are responsible for designing courses that meet learners’ needs and achieve objectives.</p>



<p>Instructional designers do this in a few ways. First, they&#8217;ll analyze learners&#8217; preferences and characteristics to ensure that the learning experience is tailored to their needs. Based on this analysis, they’ll design and structure the learning experience. They’ll test, gather feedback, and make revisions. They&#8217;ll use this evaluation to find opportunities for improvement.</p>



<p>Using an instructional designer can take the manual labor out of course building and make your courses an engaging experience. When finding the perfect instructional designer for your project, there are specific qualifications that you should look for. Here are some criteria to remember when hiring an instructional designer for your next course.</p>



<h2 id="h-qualifications-to-look-for-in-an-instructional-designer">Qualifications to Look for in an Instructional Designer</h2>



<p>An instructional designer needs a combination of education, experience, and skills to be effective. Here are some of the qualities to keep an eye out for.</p>



<h3 id="h-experience-with-instructional-design-tools-and-technology">Experience with instructional design tools and technology</h3>



<p>You’ll need someone with experience using instructional design software, authoring tools, and learning management systems. For example, if you’re using LearnDash, your designer should know how to build within the LearnDash LMS. They should also be familiar with current trends in educational technology and be able to integrate new technologies. They should also have experience in project management to ensure the course-building project is executed successfully.</p>



<h3 id="h-strong-understanding-of-learning-theory">Strong understanding of learning theory</h3>



<p>A strong understanding of learning theories, such as behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism, is essential. Understanding how learners learn will ensure courses are designed to promote engagement from the start. Look for evidence that designers have applied these theories to create effective learning experiences.</p>



<h3 id="h-ability-to-evaluate-the-effectiveness-of-instructional-design">Ability to evaluate the effectiveness of instructional design</h3>



<p>Instructional designers should be able to think creatively to design engaging and effective experiences. They should also be able to think critically to test their designs&#8217; effectiveness and make improvements. They should have strong communication skills to communicate about the project with you clearly and effectively.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-instructional-designers">Where to Find Instructional Designers</h2>

<p>When people hear the term “artificial intelligence” they tend to think of rogue robots, anarchic androids or sinister cyborgs taking over the world and giving humanity the same short shrift that the asteroid gave to the dinosaurs all of those years ago. While, we admit, an AI-induced apocalypse might—but probably won’t—one day come to pass, the AI that we have today is here to help.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll show you how to use OpenAI and ChatGPT models with LearnDash so you can harness the power of AI for your e-learning platform. Automatically draft lessons, create course outlines, and even answer students’ questions with the help of AI and automation tools such as Uncanny Automator.</p>



<p>Join the robot revolution in e-learning—and save yourself countless hours and thousands of dollars in the process!</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction-to-openai-and-chatgpt"><strong>Introduction to OpenAI and ChatGPT</strong></h2>



<p>OpenAI is the artificial intelligence research laboratory behind the popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Built on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) model, ChatGPT is the very latest in natural language processing (NLP) technology.</p>



<p>With a beta version that launched in 2020, the AI uses statistical modeling and deep learning to create human-like text. That’s basically just the high-tech way of saying that ChatGPT read a lot (and we mean A LOT) of content across the internet to learn how people write on various topics so that it could do the same.</p>

<p>Since ChatGPT’s official launch in November 2022, the internet has had fun prompting it to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/chatgpt-ai-text-university-waterloo-maura-grossman-1.6703819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make poems</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://maximumeffort.substack.com/p/i-taught-chatgpt-to-invent-a-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create languages</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/i-asked-chatgpt-ai-to-write-a-harry-potter-fan-fiction-the-result-will-blow-your-mind-2d4f25cc705d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compose fan fiction</a>—but the advanced AI can do so much more.</p>



<p>You’ll need to&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create an account</a>&nbsp;with OpenAI to power your e-learning platform with artificial intelligence. To create an account, all you need is an email and a password—and the ability to take a single-question Turing test to prove that you are not, yourself, a robot.</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction-to-learndash"><strong>Introduction to LearnDash</strong></h2>



<p>LearnDash is the #1 learning management system (LMS) for WordPress. Whether you’re running an after school program or managing training and compliance for a multinational corporation, LearnDash has all of the features you need to create a functional (and futuristic) digital classroom.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-2.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash LearnDash Homepage" class="wp-image-125284"/></figure></div>


<p>With LearnDash, you can easily build your e-learning platform from the ground up—from granular lessons and quizzes, up to modules and even course groups that define entire curricula. And don’t forget to keep your students motivated with certificates for completion or outstanding grades.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already,&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/share/learndash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>&nbsp;to get the LearnDash plugin and join the future of e-learning!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-benefits-of-automation-and-ai-in-e-learning"><strong>The Benefits of Automation and AI in E-learning</strong></h2>



<p>Pairing your LearnDash LMS with OpenAI comes with several benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Save Time:</strong>&nbsp;OpenAI churns out large amounts of text faster than a caffeinated cartoon typist. Cut back on the time it takes you to create course content, leaving you more time to interact with your students.</li>



<li><strong>Save Money:</strong>&nbsp;Cut back on your content creation costs with OpenAI by reducing the amount of time it takes to generate quality content.</li>



<li><strong>Stay on Brand:</strong>&nbsp;Once you find the right configurations and prompts for your OpenAI model, you’ll be able to rapidly produce content that is consistent and on-brand.</li>
</ul>



<p>Developers and educators are constantly finding new ways to apply AI to e-learning. But here are just some of the ways that you can start using AI in your LearnDash LMS today:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Create Course Outlines:</strong>&nbsp;Standardize your course creation process and help educators save time with auto-generated course outlines.</li>



<li><strong>Draft Lessons:</strong>&nbsp;Use simple forms or other input methods to automate the process of drafting new lessons.</li>



<li><strong>Tutor and Support:</strong>&nbsp;Once you get the hang of OpenAI, you can create chatbots to help tutor your students and support them through the learning process.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the following sections, we’re going to actually walk through the steps of connecting LearnDash to OpenAI. You’ll need at least the Pro version of&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/">Uncanny Automator</a>&nbsp;to follow along, however Automator offers a 14-day money back guarantee so trying out premium features comes at no-risk to you.</p>



<p>After you’ve downloaded Automator Pro,&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/open-ai/">read this guide</a>&nbsp;on connecting it with your new OpenAI account or find the abridged version below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Under your account tab in your OpenAI account page, click on&nbsp;<strong>View API keys</strong>. In the&nbsp;<em>API Keys</em>&nbsp;screen, click&nbsp;<strong>Create new secret key</strong>&nbsp;and copy the new key.</li>



<li>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Settings</em>. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Premium integrations</strong>&nbsp;tab and scroll down to&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>.</li>



<li>Paste the key from your OpenAI account into the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Secret key</em>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Connect OpenAI account</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now you’re ready to power your LearnDash LMS with OpenAI!</p>



<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-generated-course-outline"><strong>Build an AI-Generated Course Outline</strong></h2>



<p>OpenAI is, perhaps unsurprisingly, great at understanding structure—it is, after all, a computer. That makes it the perfect teacher’s assistant when it comes to creating course outlines. Here’s how it’s done.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-create-a-new-recipe"><strong>Step 1: Create a New Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Add New</em>. In the pop-up window that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Logged-in users</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/How-to-Automate-Your-Customer-Onboarding-Process-25-%E2%80%94-Recipe-type-selector-Logged-in-users.png" alt="Automator Recipe type selector Logged-in users" class="wp-image-120181"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-2-name-your-recipe"><strong>Step 2: Name Your Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve named this recipe&nbsp;<em>OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline</em>&nbsp;but we recommend coming up with whatever naming convention suits your workflows best.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-configure-your-trigger-s"><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Trigger(s)</strong></h3>



<p>The trigger is the event that will set your recipe into motion. For our workflows, we’ve created a WPForms form to pass information to OpenAI. Based on the OpenAI inputs (that we’ll discuss later), a basic form can look something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-4.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms" class="wp-image-125285"/></figure></div>


<p>A form-based trigger can be useful to restrict direct access to OpenAI while still allowing multiple users to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>To use a form-based trigger, in the&nbsp;<em>Triggers</em>&nbsp;panel, from the menu of available integrations, click&nbsp;<strong>WPForms</strong>&nbsp;or your preferred form-building plugin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-5.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator WPForms Integration" class="wp-image-125286"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>A user submits a form</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-6.png" alt="Automator WPForms Action A user submits a form" class="wp-image-125287"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will prompt you to select a form. After you’ve selected your course outline creator form, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your trigger should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-7.png" alt="Automator WPForms Action A user submits a form Live" class="wp-image-125288"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-4-configure-your-primary-action"><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Primary Action</strong></h3>



<p>In the Actions panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. From the menu of available integrations, select&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-8.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI Integration" class="wp-image-125289"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text with the Davinci model</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-9.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Use prompt to generate text with the Davinci Model" class="wp-image-125290"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will present you with an editor where you can configure the information that it will pass along to OpenAI.</p>



<p><em>Temperature</em>&nbsp;defines how “creative” you want OpenAI to be in its response with lower values indicating less creativity and higher values indicating more creativity.</p>



<p><em>Maximum length</em>&nbsp;refers to the number of tokens that OpenAI has, with 100 OpenAI tokens roughly correlating to 75 English language words. For a comprehensive breakdown of OpenAI tokens,&nbsp;<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Not to be confused with OpenAI’s tokens, Automator has its own&nbsp;<em>tokens</em>&nbsp;(i.e., dynamic pieces of data pulled from your website and even from within recipes).</p>



<p>In our example, we’re allowing users to pass along both&nbsp;<em>temperature</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>maximum length</em>&nbsp;information to OpenAI by using Automator tokens that pull data from the WPForms trigger. To use Automator tokens, click on the&nbsp;<strong>Asterisk</strong>&nbsp;and select a token from the drop-down list.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-10.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Tokens" class="wp-image-125291"/></figure></div>


<p>Note: In practice,&nbsp;<em>temperature</em>&nbsp;is correlated to your brand’s voice and OpenAI calculates cost based on the number of tokens you use. As such, you may not want to permit all users to change those settings and opt, instead, to use static values in those fields.</p>



<p>Using all Automator tokens, we’ve filled in the remaining fields as such:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-11.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Tokens" class="wp-image-125292"/></figure></div>


<p>Once you’ve filled in the fields in the way that best suits your workflows, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your action should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-12.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Use prompt to generate text with the Davinci Model Live" class="wp-image-125293"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-5-configure-your-secondary-action"><strong>Step 5: Configure Your Secondary Action</strong></h3>



<p>The first action that we’ve created will get OpenAI to generate our course outline. This secondary action will get that course outline created in LearnDash.</p>



<p>In the&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. From the menu of available integrations, select&nbsp;<strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-13.png" alt="Automator WordPress Integration" class="wp-image-125294"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Create a post</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-14.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post" class="wp-image-125295"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will present you with an editor, similar to the one from the first OpenAI action. In the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Type</em>, select&nbsp;<em>Course</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-15.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post Type Course" class="wp-image-125296"/></figure></div>


<p>In the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Content</em>&nbsp;is where we’re going to include the output from OpenAI. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Asterisk</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text with the Davinci model</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Response</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-16.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Tokens Response" class="wp-image-125297"/></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, in the&nbsp;<em>Title</em>&nbsp;field, use the&nbsp;<em>Course Title</em>&nbsp;token from the WPForms trigger to automatically generate your course title.</p>



<p>Once you’re finished, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel should now look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-17.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI and LearnDash Actions" class="wp-image-125298"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-6-it-s-alive-it-s-alive"><strong>Step 6: It’s Alive! It’s Alive!</strong></h3>



<p>The last thing for you to do is to toggle the recipe from&nbsp;<em>Draft</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Live</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-21.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline Recipe" class="wp-image-125299"/></figure></div>


<p>Just for fun, here’s the course outline that OpenAI returned from the information that we put in our form:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-22.png" alt="OpenAI Sample Writing Introduction to Supercomputers" class="wp-image-125300"/></figure></div>


<p>…maybe the AI is sentient after all.</p>



<p>Note: OpenAI is fast—but not necessarily instantaneous. It can take a few seconds to return content, so if you don’t see a new post right after it runs, wait approximately 30 seconds. The time it will take also depends on the model you choose (Davinci is slowest) and the number of tokens you allow (more tokens means more time). If the action times out, consider changing the model or reducing the number of tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-generated-lesson"><strong>Build an AI-Generated Lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we have our outline, it’s time to generate the lessons that will make up the bulk of our course content. And if anyone knows anything about supercomputers, it’s probably OpenAI—<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-builds-a-supercomputer-for-openai-for-training-massive-ai-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s built on one</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-create-a-new-recipe-1"><strong>Step 1: Create a New Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Add New</em>. In the pop-up window that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Logged-in users</em>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-2-name-your-recipe-1"><strong>Step 2: Name Your Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve named this recipe&nbsp;<em>OpenAI Lesson Generator</em>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-configure-your-trigger"><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Trigger</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll be using the same form submission trigger with a different form for this recipe as we did with the last one, albeit with a much higher temperature.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-23.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms Lesson" class="wp-image-125301"/></figure></div>


<p>In the&nbsp;<em>Triggers</em>&nbsp;panel of the recipe builder, from the menu of available integrations, click&nbsp;<strong>WPForms</strong>&nbsp;or your preferred form-building plugin</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-24.gif" alt="Automator WPForms Trigger A user submits a form" class="wp-image-125302"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-4-configure-your-primary-action-1"><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Primary Action</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll be using the same primary action for this recipe as we did in the previous one with slightly different configurations for OpenAI.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-25.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash OpenAI Prompt Editor" class="wp-image-125303"/></figure></div>


<p>Once you’re finished, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-5-configure-your-secondary-action-1"><strong>Step 5: Configure Your Secondary Action</strong></h3>



<p>This secondary action is also very similar to the secondary action from the first recipe, with the only difference being that we’re creating a lesson instead of a course.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-26.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post Type Lesson" class="wp-image-125304"/></figure></div>


<p>Your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel should look something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-27.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI and LearnDash Actions Lesson" class="wp-image-125305"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-6-go-live"><strong>Step 6: Go Live</strong></h3>



<p>Toggle your recipe from&nbsp;<em>Draft</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Live</em>. It should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-28.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI LearnDash Lesson Draft Recipe" class="wp-image-125306"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s a snippet of the lesson that OpenAI returned:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-29.png" alt="OpenAI Sample Writing on Introduction to Supercomputers" class="wp-image-125308"/></figure></div>


<h2 id="h-generate-unique-featured-images-for-your-new-content"><strong>Generate Unique Featured Images for Your New Content</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wondered what artificial intelligence does in its spare time, wonder no longer: it creates beautiful works of art.</p>



<p>With OpenAI’s image-generator, DALL-E 2, you can create original images that suit your needs—no matter how outlandish they are. Even if you asked DALL-E 2 to generate totally random images of, say, “a kangaroo dressed as a French artist sitting at an easel in the desert at dusk, digital art”.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-101.png" alt="DALL-E 2 images of a kangaroo painting in a desert" class="wp-image-127258"/></figure></div>


<p>Now that you see what DALL-E 2 can do and you’ve created some new course and lesson content, it’s time to add original featured images using Automator’s OpenAI integration.</p>



<p>We modified our original WPForms form to include an image prompt field.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-102.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms course and image prompt form" class="wp-image-127260"/></figure></div>


<p>Next, in our&nbsp;<em>OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline</em>&nbsp;recipe, we’ll add the action to generate an image using the prompt from our updated form.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-103.gif" alt="Automator OpenAI integration to generate an image" class="wp-image-127261"/></figure></div>


<p>In our WordPress action to create a post, we simply add the image URL token from our OpenAI action into the&nbsp;<em>Featured image URL</em>&nbsp;field.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-104.png" alt="Automator OpenAI integration image url tokens" class="wp-image-127264"/></figure></div>


<p>Note: Actions in Automator occur sequentially as they appear on screen. If the OpenAI action to generate an image appears after the WordPress action to create a post, then the image url tokens will not appear in the WordPress action. To correct this, simply drag the OpenAI action above the WordPress action and the image url tokens will appear.</p>



<p>With the action to generate an image, your new recipe should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Our new course outline now includes some amazing, AI-generated artwork.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Automator also saved us the trouble of downloading the image ourselves and uploaded it directly into our WordPress media library.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-powered-chatbot-for-students"><strong>Build an AI-Powered Chatbot for Students</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we have AI-generated course content, why not extend the power of AI to&nbsp; support your students with a chatbot?</p>

<p>Now, with this recipe, every time a student asks a question on your site, Automator will route the question to OpenAI and the student will get an immediate AI-generated answer. For questions about learning content, students can get an immediate—and hopefully helpful—answer instead of waiting for an instructor. It’s like they’ll have their own (virtual) teacher’s assistant!</p>



<p>In the (not-so-distant) future, you’ll be able to train OpenAI on your specific documentation and content so that it can even provide more detailed course and site feedback. Imagine a more dynamic AI that can provide context-sensitive answers, based on your own content!</p>



<p>We’re not quite there yet, but it’s coming soon.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While online learning has myriad benefits, there’s one large problem: how to prevent </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-ways-to-fight-cheating-in-elearning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing cheating in online courses is challenging for a variety of reasons, including limited supervision, technological advancements, pressures to succeed, and a lack of awareness of academic integrity policies.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several common reasons why learners may cheat in online courses. Learners want to do well or need to achieve a certain score to pass, so they’ll look for a backdoor solution to get the score they need. One additional pressure may be the online environment itself. It’s often hard to </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/8-types-of-motivation-for-online-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stay motivated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when learning by yourself at a computer screen, so shortcuts seem even more tempting.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, cheating sometimes occurs because learners may not see any consequence. They may be unaware that the instructor uses anti-cheating or plagiarism-checking software to check their work. In addition, perhaps the academic integrity classroom policies are unclear. You may have assumed learners would never cheat and therefore neglected to include a clear policy for the punishment of doing so.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing cheating in online courses for children requires a combination of strategies, including clear communication about academic integrity, effective monitoring and detection, and proactive efforts to prevent cheating. It also requires collaboration between educators, parents, and learners to ensure everyone is committed to upholding academic integrity.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not preventing cheating has serious implications. You won’t be able to gain a clear assessment of their abilities. Plus, learners will be unable to demonstrate their learning in other scenarios. Letting learners get away with passing scores can reflect poorly upon your future credibility, too.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s no silver bullet to solving this problem, here are a few of the steps you can take to mitigate it.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prevent-cheating"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Prevent Cheating&nbsp;</span></h2>



<ol>
<li> <span style="color: var(--global-palette3); font-family: Queens; font-size: 24px;">Build a culture of academic honesty</span> </li>
</ol>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic integrity ensures fairness, promotes learning, protects credibility, and fosters personal integrity. To start, be sure learners understand what cheating is and why it’s wrong. You could include this in your first unit and make learners acknowledge that they’ve read and understood the policy to hold them accountable. You can even add a discussion forum where students discuss why they think cheating happens and what the consequences could be. Having it out in the open will make it feel socially unacceptable to cheat.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 id="h-1-design-questions-that-require-personal-reflection"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Design questions that require personal reflection&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to cheat when you’re asked to write from personal experience. Ask learners to give examples from their lives in answer to a question. This can work beyond just writing and reading courses. Ask learners for their opinions on whatever your course topic may be, and how they plan to apply that knowledge to the real world. It’s hard for learners to share personal answers, and finding a similar answer online requires enough knowledge of the subject matter to identify the correct example.</span></p>



<h3 id="h-2-use-assessment-strategies-that-make-cheating-difficult"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Use assessment strategies that make cheating difficult</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheating becomes more tempting the higher the stakes are. Making a single test worth half the learner’s final grade can make even well-intentioned folks crack under the pressure. Instead of one big exam, create smaller </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-ways-make-better-quizzes-course/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">micro-quizzes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> throughout the course. A 5-question review quiz isn’t significant enough for learners to try to cheat. And a confident learner who has passed review quizzes won’t risk cheating for a grade they think they can earn.</span></p>



<h3 id="h-3-offer-open-book-exams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Offer open-book exams</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevent learners from searching on Google by letting them use the class materials. Even better: encourage them. Create more difficult questions that are specific to your course topic and would be hard to find online. Your students will still have to research in the book to find the answers they’re looking for—a process that challenges their critical thinking and leads to a richer learning experience. As a bonus, your learners will gain some practical knowledge of how to effectively search for information.</span></p>



<h3 id="h-4-implement-technical-safeguards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Implement technical safeguards</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you suspect a student plagiarizes a written assignment, run it through a plagiarism checker. Randomize quizzes by creating a large question bank. Randomized quizzes prevent students from sharing answers with each other. Set a timer on quizzes so learners who take too long to look up answers won’t have time to finish. Together, these measures make it hard for an individual to cheat without help from multiple peers. And, if you’ve created a culture of integrity, they won’t reach out and ask.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 id="h-learndash-integrity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Integrity&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to prevent cheating and protect the integrity of your online course is through the </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/integrity-add-on/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Integrity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> add-on. Here are a few of the preventative tools included:&nbsp;</span></p>



<ul>
<li><b>Prevent Hotlinking.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hotlinking is the act of stealing someone’s bandwidth or server resources by linking directly to their website’s assets, such as images or videos. Preventing hotlinking can crack down on learners sharing lesson material with others.&nbsp;</span></li>



<li><b>Prevent Concurrent Login</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Concurrent login is when one user with a single username and password logs in at the same time from a different location or device. With this prevention in place. Whenever someone else logs in under the same username/email while the learner is also logged in, they will get an error prompt. This prevents users from sharing logins. Of course, you can also choose to have certain user roles excluded from this feature if needed.</span></li>



<li><b>Prevent Content Copy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This option disables the “Copy” and “Paste” functions on your website, in addition to the entire right-click functionality. Although this is not a foolproof method to prevent copying, this may discourage users from copying and pasting content from your course website.</span></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-protect-your-courses-today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect Your Courses Today&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you employ all the above strategies, you won’t make cheating impossible, but you will make it impractical.

<p>The benefits of a blended, online learning component in education are too great to ignore.</p>



<p>Many universities are aware of these benefits: about 90% of public institutions offer online classes. Plus,<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 75% of all college students</a> have taken at least one course online in recent years.</p>



<p>There have been countless studies indicating the benefits of blended elearning environments, and students agree. The<a href="https://research.com/education/online-education-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> vast majority</a> of students agree that online learning is just as good or about the same as in-person instruction.</p>



<p>Technology&#8217;s importance in the classroom and in educational institutions as a whole continues to increase now that blended learning environments have become the norm.</p>



<p>Some of the most impactful benefits of online learning to education institutions include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Increasing student learning by motivation through awards</li>



<li>Reducing the need for physical space, which can increase enrollment size</li>



<li>Many learning styles can be addressed</li>



<li>Economies of scale through the reuse of materials</li>



<li>Reducing overhead by transferring educational activities online</li>
</ol>



<p>Let’s explore each of these factors below.</p>



<h2 id="h-motivation-through-awards">Motivation through awards</h2>



<p>Motivation is<a href="https://www.learndash.com/8-types-of-motivation-for-online-learning/"> a critical component of successful learning</a>. Online learning can keep motivation high through awards and recognition, such as digital badges or certificates. These small digital tokens can encourage learners to stay focused and gamify the learning process a bit. These awards can also be shared on social media, providing learners with a sense of achievement and recognition that can further motivate them to continue learning.</p>



<h2 id="h-increased-enrollment-size">Increased enrollment size</h2>



<p>One of the significant advantages of online learning is the ability to scale up enrollment sizes. Online courses can accommodate larger numbers of learners, with no need for physical classrooms or other overheads that might limit class sizes. This means that online learning platforms can reach more learners and provide education to a broader audience. Larger online classes can also result in a more diverse student body. This can lead to more robust options for discussions, collaboration, and peer learning.</p>



<h2 id="h-variety-of-learning-styles">Variety of learning styles</h2>



<p>Online learning also makes education more accessible to a wider range of learners. Videos, podcasts, and interactive simulations can engage learners and facilitate different learning styles. This variety of learning styles can help ensure that all learners can access the material in ways that are best suited to their needs and preferences. Learners can grasp ideas in a way that makes the most sense to them, with the potential for higher levels of satisfaction.</p>



<h2 id="h-reusable-materials">Reusable materials</h2>



<p>Online learning provides the opportunity to create and reuse educational materials. Materials can be updated and refined over time, making the courses more efficient, effective, and relevant. By reusing materials, online learning platforms can also reduce the time and resources needed to create new courses.</p>



<h2 id="h-reduced-overhead">Reduced overhead</h2>



<p>Online learning platforms do not require physical classrooms, equipment, or other resources that traditional courses need. This can lead to lower costs for enrollment, making education more accessible to a broader range of people. Rather than spending resources on maintaining physical spaces, online classes can focus on delivering high-quality content. This can lead to a more effective and efficient learning experience for both learners and instructors.</p>

<h2 id="h-track-coursework">Track Coursework&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once enrolled in a course, the Reliablesoft Digital Marketing Academy includes a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/user-profiles/">User Profile</a> so learners have an easy way to track and manage their courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the profile page, users can:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>View all enrolled courses</li>



<li>Edit their profile information</li>



<li>Jump back into a course where they left off</li>



<li>View awarded points &amp; quiz grades</li>



<li>Access any certificates they have earned</li>
</ul>



<p>The best way to include a LearnDash profile is to use the block (or shortcode) that comes with LearnDash. No additional plugins are required! You simply create a page on your site and insert the block/shortcode where you want the profile information to appear. And just like that, learners will easily be able to track their progress.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-focus-mode-for-increased-engagement">Focus Mode for Increased Engagement</h2>



<p>Once inside a lesson, the Academy uses <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/focus-mode/">Focus Mode</a> to keep learners engaged. When you enable Focus Mode, the main navigation &amp; footer elements are removed from the page. Course navigation is always visible in a sidebar tray, and course progress is always visible at the top of the screen. A “mark complete” appears as well to help track progress on each lesson page.&nbsp; You can always exit the course easily in the top right navigation bar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Focus Mode aims to eliminate distractions &amp; streamline the learning experience – increasing learning retention and completion rates. The lesson content itself is also optimized by using headers, videos, bullets, and call-out boxes all to promote learning and engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every online educator dreams of creating a course that helps learners fulfill their goals. However, taking a course idea and turning it into a thoughtful, engaging experience can be more difficult than it looks. While the hard work is often worth it, going in unprepared can cause many new course designers to feel disheartened. A lot of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-instructional-design-principles-to-improve-your-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instructional design</a> is about planning a course properly.</p>



<p>Before discouragement sets in, take a look at some likely future setbacks and create an action plan for them now. Knowing how to approach these problems proactively will keep you from being caught off guard. It will also give you the confidence you need to push forward without losing momentum.</p>



<p>Here are the top seven challenges that you may face when designing your first course, paired with the strategies to overcome them.  </p>



<h2 id="h-1-creating-engaging-content-for-learners">1. Creating engaging content for learners</h2>



<p>There is so much content to be made in a course, and it can be a tough job to always be engaging. But it’s worth it: creating engaging content that captures and holds attention can motivate learners and encourage them to stay focused, which can increase their knowledge retention and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few ways to make sure your content stays engaging:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tell stories.</strong> Instead of just presenting facts, write out scenarios and examples to convey a message, demonstrate a concept, and engage your audience.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Incorporate interactive elements.</strong> Interactivity can come through forums, community, or gamification (among other things). This could be as simple as asking a question and providing an option to comment, or as complex as adding a quiz or poll. </li>



<li><strong>Use multimedia</strong>. Multimedia elements such as videos, images, and audio clips can liven up a wall of text. They can also help to break up long lessons, making them easier to read.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Keep it brief</strong>. You need to thoughtfully “chunk,” or break up, your lesson content in a digestible way so learners are better able to pace themselves and engage with your content. Use topics, multiple check-ins, and drip feeding to break up your delivery.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-2-difficulty-in-creating-accessible-materials">2. Difficulty in Creating Accessible Materials</h2>



<p>Accessible instructional materials help ensure that all students can access and benefit from the same educational opportunities as their peers. Accessible instructional materials also help learners participate at their own pace and foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for all students.</p>



<p>Being accessible means ditching flashy graphics and fun fonts. Add captions and downloadable transcripts for videos. Make fonts clean and colors minimal. Use alternative text (alt-text) to describe the image and its purpose for visually impaired learners. Use descriptive headings so screen readers can interpret the content. <strong>Take the time to make these a part of your design process now so it becomes second nature. </strong></p>



<h2 id="h-3-difficulty-in-identifying-learning-objectives">3. Difficulty in Identifying Learning Objectives</h2>



<p>Resist the urge to lure people in with generic promises to make them better. You’ll need to be reasonable in what your course can achieve in the amount of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help identify your learning objectives, plan out your major course milestones. These can be the major projects, tests, or achievements in your course. Then, use your milestones to create a course outline. How many lessons are there before the first test, and in between tests, for example? Then, consider the work holistically. What are all of your lessons and milestones really teaching the learner? That’s your course objective, or outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good way to build towards an objective is to scaffold the learning. Scaffolding introduces new ideas in phases that build upon one another, leading to more complicated work by the end of the course. One learning framework called <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> outlines how you can scaffold learning objectives:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Remember</li>



<li>Understand</li>



<li>Apply</li>



<li>Analyze</li>



<li>Evaluate</li>



<li>Create</li>
</ol>



<p>With this model, early units are likely to focus on activities that help learners understand concepts, while later units will introduce analyzing, evaluating, and creating, such as in a final project or paper. Using this framework will help ensure that your individual assessments and course milestones are aligned with your course objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-keeping-up-with-emerging-instructional-tools-and-technology">4. Keeping up with emerging instructional tools and technology</h2>



<p>The educational landscape is constantly changing and evolving. New technologies and pedagogical approaches are emerging all the time. Staying informed will help instructional designers create more effective learning experiences as well as stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emerging technologies within the e-learning industry itself are likely to become major differentiators, as some courses stick more visibly to a traditional teaching plan, and others venture into experimental waters. Knowing what your options are—and being prepared to incorporate them if need be—can help you find ways to innovate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep up with emerging tools and technologies, look for workshops and conferences that you can attend. There are always pieces of training, including our own <a href="http://learndash.com/webinars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LearnDash Webinars</a>, that aim to keep course creators ahead of the trend. You can also find and follow relevant blogs and social media accounts in the industry for daily updates. </p>



<h2 id="h-5-designing-for-broad-audiences">5. Designing for broad audiences</h2>



<p>You can’t cover every aspect of your topic for every kind of learner. If you go too wide, your lessons will feel shallow and lack substance. However, if you tighten your audience niche, you can go deeper into the topic, where true learning happens.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c96lzqQUnBd5-70jzKReJSjnQfqaGqZA2B5oZeQw7GhMRpNsFoV40D-Ulvvb-Bmm2gG1LzV7Zi8Z37P_my7GsKqYKJTN9jB1M88_rTKiflcePMvJprEs_sDMYEulTPgPd-ebIVqjcXRqoeKDXzmeUw" alt="Example of deep &amp; narrow instructional design vs. wide &amp; shallow instructional design"/></figure></div>


<p>To find a niche where you can dive deep, think: What are your credentials or experience in this topic? What special and specific knowledge do you have that others will want to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To discover how effective your niche learning is, you’ll need to properly assess your assignments. One of the best tools for assessment is rubrics. Share a rubric with your assignment instructions to help clarify expectations and highlight how the assignment aligns with your learning outcomes. This can be an important measure of how well your learners are understanding course concepts, and if your assignments are hitting the sweet spot of difficulty. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-lack-of-time-and-resources">6. Lack of Time and Resources</h2>



<p>You’d love to spend all the time in the world designing your course, but it’s just not possible. Other course demands, not to mention grading, can take a significant amount of time. </p>



<p>Early in the design process, embrace <a href="https://www.learndash.com/ld-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">templates</a>. Most templates are optimized for online learning and have accessibility features in place. Chunking and scaffolding will come naturally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the class is live, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/automate-course-management-tasks-learndash-zapier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">automate</a> as much as you can. Consider automating weekly email check-ins, feedback after quiz scores, or reminders for due dates. This still gives the learner a personal connection to you without you having to craft dozens of emails. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-supporting-learners-through-the-rough-spots">7. Supporting learners through the rough spots</h2>



<p>Just as you’ll hit some rough spots when designing the course, your learners will also hit some <a href="https://www.learndash.com/does-your-course-suffer-from-learner-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult patches</a>. Be ready with a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-ways-provide-student-support-e-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping hand</a> in the form of check-ins, micro quizzes, and even online office hours where you can schedule a meeting to see how they&#8217;re doing. A little bit of outreach can go a long way.</p>



<p>It isn’t possible to predict all of the challenges you might face in the design process, but these major categories can keep you from stalling out early. Knowing what to expect can keep you on the right path when challenges inevitably arise.</p>



<p>Don’t stop with this list, either. Think about the specific needs and concerns of your learners, and be proactive in addressing them. The more you think about your course from the perspective of your students, the stronger your design will be.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>If you create online courses, you’ve likely heard of instructional design. <a href="https://www.learndash.com/3-instructional-design-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instructional design</a> is the theory and rationale behind how we create courses. It provides a framework for how to design a course to match the way people tend to learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instructional design is a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/category/instructional-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large field</a>, and there’s a lot to learn. Along the way, you may feel as though you’ll never be ready to launch because your course will never meet all of the standards.</p>



<p>But it’s not about meeting every single standard. In fact, you mainly need to avoid these four instructional design pitfalls:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Lack of clear objectives</li>



<li>Not considering the audience&nbsp;</li>



<li>Overloading content</li>



<li>Neglecting evaluation and feedback&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>If you focus on these four pillars and avoid falling into their trap, you should feel fully confident in your course design.&nbsp; Let’s dive into each of these four areas below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-1-lack-of-clear-learning-objectives">Mistake #1: Lack of Clear Learning Objectives</h2>



<p>A learning objective is the outcome that you want your learners to achieve by the end of your course. Think of a learning objective as one new niche skill or secret to success in your industry that the learner can take with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, the smaller the promise, the better. It will lead to higher learner satisfaction, as it’s more likely that most learners will hit that goal. However, you don’t want to be too specific up front, as it can intimidate learners who may feel they’ll never be able to achieve the goal you’re promising. Instead, aim to create a balanced, true assessment.</p>



<p>Remember: course objectives are achieved by the <em>end</em> of your course, so don’t feel pressured to start covering every topic in unit one. However, each unit should be designed to lead to overall course outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-2-not-considering-the-audience">Mistake #2: Not Considering the Audience</h2>



<p>If you don’t know exactly who your course is for, it’ll feel unfocused and unhelpful. First, ask yourself who your ideal student is. The more clearly you can identify this persona, the easier it is to target their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Find your ideal student by analyzing your audience. Create surveys or ask for feedback on social media. Collect and analyze your responses to determine your average learner. Keep this person in mind as you design your course. It will feel as if it’s written for them, and they’ll be delighted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not knowing your audience will lead to ineffective design. Your lessons will feel too general or try to cover too much at once. Avoid the temptation of having mass appeal. Instead, design for a niche to build authority, gain trust, and increase the perceived value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-3-overloading-on-content">Mistake #3: Overloading on Content</h2>



<p>information overload often happens when instructors get carried away with their material. A lesson with too much content will look overwhelming and deter your learners from ever getting started. You’ll need to thoughtfully “chunk,” or break up, your lesson content in a digestible way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to structure each lesson around one key point. Start small and then slowly increase more difficult and complicated topics or scenarios. Consider <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-micro-learning-in-your-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro content</a> that can be completed in a matter of minutes, like small activities or quizzes released daily. This helps learners build a pattern of checking in and refreshing their knowledge.</p>



<p>In addition, find ways to introduce different lesson formats. Maybe you have three or four lessons in your usual format, and then have the fifth lesson be a more involved scenario-based design. Alternate the conclusion between a video quiz and a class-based assignment. Either way,&nbsp; mix up your content so that the lessons don’t blend together and start to feel overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-4-neglecting-evaluation-and-feedback">Mistake #4: Neglecting Evaluation and Feedback</h2>



<p>Neglecting to gather feedback and course evaluations will do nothing to help your course. It’s important to know how learners perceive your information. After all, what seems simple and easy for you may not to them, so try to understand from their point of view as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To gather feedback, consider using exit surveys or satisfaction polls. Use can use guided questions and ranking scales. Also consider offering a final reflection essay question at the end of your course. This’ll help both you and your learners assess and understand their progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember that feedback is an <a href="https://www.learndash.com/responding-positively-negative-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity for improvement.</a> If you’re hearing that the lessons are too long, break them up. When learners are struggling to pass quizzes, offer shorter, more frequent review quizzes. Or, if learners are dropping out at the same point in your course, check in with them personally and see what support they need to finish.</p>



<p>And if you are getting great feedback, listen to what your learners love and double down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-work-smarter-with-instructional-design">Work Smarter with Instructional Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It’s unlikely your course will ever feel fully finished, but that doesn’t mean it’s not ready. In fact, the more you hold back launching your course, the longer it will take to gather the feedback you need to make it better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you recognize some of these errors in a course you’ve already launched, there’s nothing stopping you from making updates. And if you’re confident your course isn’t committing any of these four major instructional design mistakes, then it’s time to put it in front of learners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an online course creator&#8217;s worst fear.</p>



<p>Spending countless nights working on the most valuable content possible, only to have no one sign up for your course.</p>



<p>Your potential students don&#8217;t receive the education they need to get to that next level, and you don&#8217;t get rewarded for all your hard work.</p>



<p>A lose-lose for everybody  .</p>



<p><strong>But don&#8217;t worry, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.</strong></p>



<p>Your course landing page is your opportunity to showcase the value of your course and convince potential students to take the next step and enroll.</p>



<p>If you can direct your audience to a course landing page that&#8217;s optimized for conversions, you&#8217;ll be seeing new signup notifications come in faster than you can swipe them away.</p>



<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll be sharing seven essential elements that every high-converting sales page should include.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-a-compelling-headline-that-communicates-the-benefits-of-your-course">1) A compelling headline that communicates the benefits of your course.</h2>



<p>The first thing your potential students will see is your headline, so it&#8217;s important to spend all the time you need to get this right.</p>



<p>The best course sales page headlines are specific, compelling, and action-oriented.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.handletteringforbeginners.com/better-lettering-course" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-4-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3668"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://ofasignup.com/free-bonuses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-2-1024x808.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3599"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://learnfigmatowp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-3-1024x505.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3602"/></a></figure>



<p>It should grab the reader&#8217;s attention, clearly communicate the benefits of your course, and encourage the reader to take action.</p>



<p>What is the outcome you&#8217;re promising your students? And why should they learn this from you as opposed to anywhere else?</p>



<p>Here are some example frameworks you can use to craft your headlines:</p>



<ul>
<li>Discover how to [Achieve a Specific Goal], even if you&#8217;ve never [Common Obstacle] before</li>



<li>How to [Achieve a Specific Goal] in [Timeframe] or less</li>



<li>Master [Topic] in [Timeframe] with [Course Name]</li>



<li>Use the [Method] to Become an Expert [Skill]</li>



<li>Want to [Specific Outcome] but don&#8217;t know where to begin?</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: ask a friend in your target audience if your headline sounds appealing to them. Their answer might surprise you.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-a-comprehensive-description-of-the-course-content-structure">2) A comprehensive description of the course content &amp; structure.</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got their attention, it&#8217;s time to expand on how you&#8217;ll deliver your promised outcome.</p>



<p>What are your students going to learn? What does the course structure look like? How is the information going to be presented?</p>



<p>This will give potential students a sense of the scope and depth of the course, and help them determine if it&#8217;s a good fit for their needs.</p>



<p>Just be careful to not give away too much of &#8216;the good stuff&#8217; here.</p>



<p>You want to continue focusing on why your content will help them achieve X, without going too deep into the details.</p>

<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: come up with a benefit for each module of your course, and use that as the outline for your course description.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-a-clean-and-professional-design">3) A clean and professional design.</h2>



<p>The design of your course landing page says a lot about how you present yourself.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s well-designed and professional, people will be more likely to trust you.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it&#8217;s cluttered or looks like it was cobbled together in an hour, it might raise questions about the quality of your content.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to take into consideration the audience that you&#8217;re targeting when choosing an aesthetic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://studio.com/classes/david-blaine-card-magic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-design-1-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example of a nicely designed course landing page" class="wp-image-3671"/></a></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling a high-end course for business professionals, you&#8217;ll want your landing page to convey a sense of luxury.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling a course on gardening, you&#8217;ll want to keep the design light &amp; fun.</p>



<p>Again, if people have a positive experience with your course landing page, they&#8217;re going to see it as an extension of the rest of your course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-theme/starter-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-design-2-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example of a nicely designed course landing page" class="wp-image-3670"/></a></figure>



<p>Getting a nice design doesn&#8217;t need to be expensive either.</p>



<p>There are plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.learndash.com/build-your-course-website-in-record-time-with-kadence-starter-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful pre-built templates</a>&nbsp;available if you&#8217;re looking to get started quickly, or&nbsp;<a href="https://newpulselabs.com/best-figma-ui-kits-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-quality UI kits</a>&nbsp;if you want to design something more custom.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: when in doubt, it&#8217;s always better to keep your design simple.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-testimonials-from-happy-customers">4) Testimonials from happy customers.</h2>



<p>Potential students will look for proof that your course actually works, and there&#8217;s no better way to show them than through testimonials.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve had students go through your course before, reach out and ask them if they&#8217;d be willing to provide a short testimonial about their experience (<a href="https://newpulselabs.com/testimonial-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great tool</a>&nbsp;that makes this entire process easy).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to get in the habit of writing these testimonials down or saving screenshots any time you see someone mention your course positively.</p>



<p>That way you&#8217;ll slowly build a repository of testimonials you can use throughout your ads, landing pages, checkout pages, email sequences etc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thedesignership.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-testimonials-1-1024x504.jpg" alt="Example course testimonials" class="wp-image-3604"/></a></figure>



<p>If you don&#8217;t currently have any testimonials, don&#8217;t worry! You still have a couple options when first starting out.</p>



<p>A) You can offer course access for a hefty discount to anyone who is willing to provide a testimonial in return.</p>



<p>B) You can showcase testimonials of people you&#8217;ve worked with in the past. They only need to comment on your expertise in your niche, and not necessarily the contents of your course.</p>



<p>You can then sprinkle in more course-specific testimonials over time as more students are enrolled.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: you can never have too many testimonials on a page!</p>



<h2 id="h-5-a-clear-and-enticing-call-to-action-cta">5) A clear and enticing call-to-action (CTA).</h2>



<p>Now that your visitor understands how they&#8217;ll benefit from taking your course, it&#8217;s time to get them to take action.</p>



<p>This is generally via a button that takes the user to your course checkout page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-cta-3-1024x380.jpg" alt="Example course CTA" class="wp-image-3673"/></figure>



<p>While this sounds straightforward, there are a couple mistakes we see people make often.</p>



<p><strong>A) They don&#8217;t use enough CTAs.</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure you present multiple opportunities throughout the page for your reader to take the next step.</p>



<p>Some people will be ready to sign up after reading your headline. Some will be ready after going through your course description. And others after they&#8217;ve gone through all testimonials.</p>



<p>Including multiple CTAs on your page makes it easier for them to take action the moment they&#8217;re ready.</p>



<p><strong>B) They use a generic call-to-action.</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll often see a button with the text &#8220;Get Started&#8221; or &#8220;Sign Up&#8221;.</p>



<p>While this is still far better than nothing, it misses out on the opportunity to give your potential student that final push.</p>



<p>Try tying your selling proposition back into your CTAs.</p>



<p>You can do this through the button text itself, or by including a subheading right above your button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://liveoffyourpassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-cta-1-1024x335.jpg" alt="Example course CTA" class="wp-image-3597"/></a></figure>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: you can use different CTAs throughout your page. Just make sure they all point to the same destination.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-a-money-back-guarantee-to-reduce-risk-for-your-student">6) A money-back guarantee to reduce risk for your student.</h2>



<p>If there&#8217;s anything stopping someone from purchasing your course, it&#8217;s the fear that they could potentially waste their time and money.</p>



<p>The more you can remove any risk from their purchase, the more likely they&#8217;ll be to sign up.</p>



<p>A common way course creators do this is through a money-back guarantee.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://habitsacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-guarantee-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Example course money-back guarantee" class="wp-image-3674"/></a></figure>



<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re teaching, there may be a couple different approaches you can use for a money-back guarantee.</p>



<p><strong>A) You can offer an *unconditional 14-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p>



<p>This option reduces risk for your student the most, as they&#8217;ll feel they have the freedom to change their mind after making the purchase.</p>



<p>The downside is that you may have students who take advantage of the guarantee &#8211; getting value from all the lessons, and then requesting a refund simply to get their money back.</p>



<p><strong>B) You can offer a *conditional 60-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p>



<p>This option often requires the student to show some kind of proof that the course didn&#8217;t work for them.</p>



<p>They tried the methods that you taught, but didn&#8217;t get the result you promised.</p>



<p>This will help prevent students from taking advantage of your money-back guarantee.</p>



<p>The downside is that since your student isn&#8217;t guaranteed a refund, this doesn&#8217;t reduce as much risk as option A.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip:&nbsp;</strong>don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment with different money-back guarantees to see how they impact your bottom line.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-a-personable-instructor-bio">7) A personable instructor bio.</h2>



<p>Courses are a highly personal experience.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just as important for your student to resonate with you as it is for them to resonate with your content.</p>



<p>By including a section about yourself (and any other instructors) on your landing page, you&#8217;re giving your potential student a chance to connect with you.</p>



<p>If you share the story of how you&#8217;ve come to be in the position you&#8217;re now in, they&#8217;re more likely to draw similarities to their own lives.</p>

<p>This month’s Customer Showcase is <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast</a>, the popular SEO WordPress plugin. With the slogan “SEO for Everyone,” Yoast has a reputation for being at the forefront of the SEO industry.</p>



<p>When Yoast decided to launch their academy to empower users on SEO best practices, they needed an LMS they could depend on. Yoast turned to LearnDash to build impressive courses to show WordPress users how to understand SEO best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore how Yoast uses LearnDash to ensure a reliable and impressive online course experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-seo-for-everyone">SEO for Everyone&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When you land on Yoast’s course page, <a href="https://yoast.com/academy/">Yoast Academy</a>, you’ll see two ways to enroll in courses. Many of Yoast’s SEO courses are free and only require email registration.</p>



<p>The option to require an email can be set in LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-access/">Course Access</a> Settings. When you set a course to Free (as opposed to Open), it requires users to register and allows you to customize a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/login-registration/">login &amp; registration</a> page to collect emails.</p>



<p>Yoast’s Premium courses use LearnDash’s Recurring Course Access feature, billed yearly. You can set this up in LearnDash with <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/paypal-settings/">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/stripe-connect/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/2checkout/">2Checkout</a>, or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/razorpay-integration/">Razorpay</a> as your payment gateway and choose how often you’d like the recurring course access to renew. You can also use this option to offer a free trial, which’ll turn into a recurring subscription after a fixed period of time.</p>

<h2 id="h-courses-at-a-glance">Courses at a glance</h2>



<p>When you click “Go to Yoast SEO Academy,” you can see all course offerings thanks to LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/course-grid/">Course Grid</a> add-on. This provides an easy way to browse the course library in a streamlined grid format. You can add a course grid to any page via the block editor or through a shortcode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding a Course Grid also allows you to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Customize the number and sort order of courses</li><li>Filter courses by category or tag, or show only enrolled courses</li><li>Show/hide Images, descriptions, and a video preview&nbsp;</li><li>Customize buttons and CTA text</li><li>And more!&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/uV7KlUxBYxkXLQmkMeZeh-UkETYlAFI83EsLT9nouTvebOcUtkCdqzxRb7OWWdNjX_5D8-1BVanFPFdfNU27v_KKKRbAOumowe_jszJOLK-YTc91SYof7yD2R3B5JN4630yueB92EKtBAYF70Ys4gdByGz9uyGLGcHn_lzRHdTI5XkIHObyyHmgnft6MPw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-thoughtfully-designed">Thoughtfully Designed</h2>



<p>Each course in Yoast’s academy was thoughtfully designed by expert instructional designers. They make the most of LearnDash’s extensive features to ensure learners are engaged throughout the entire course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Yoast Academy uses <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-focus-mode-in-learndash-3-0-benefits-learners/">Focus Mode</a>, which eliminates distractions and adds a progress bar to the course. This small gamification feature can encourage users to continue until they see that progress bar filled to 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The course content widget on the right-hand side is another essential Focus Mode feature. It provides a learner with a complete overview of the course content, including the number of topics and quizzes. You can expand each lesson to preview the topics before you get started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you click on a course, the first lesson appears right away. There are clear course outcomes that begin each lesson, with introductory videos, embedded, documents, and a custom quiz. Each step of the lesson is clear and actionable, thanks in part to LearnDash’s educational-focused features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/B0q5aLdscDvzgtjyNU2CYitWAI2KgJQTtbITsMAKmIjmDIcnwFnfmJQJPE_aFDxlX5XjCAT4I8f_hkarj8BJyHjtvKAmhKPJO1iA74Gw88COOMifj343luFrLXacEb8QS1Vwm8XWf6VwuEgLF16a8KG1JqI6qhPqvNC5vLv8X1STQfOFXM7ROpoMjVBWHQ.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-do-more-with-learndash">Do More With LearnDash</h2>



<p>Yoast turned to LearnDash to offer a full library of courses on SEO optimization, copywriting, configuration, and even multilingual SEO. More than 20,000 students have gone through Yoast&#8217;s academy, powered by LearnDash. </p>



<p>“Learndash has allowed Yoast Academy to create much more meaningful exercises,&#8221; says Joost de Valk from Yoast. &#8220;In the past, we could only dream of having users complete lines of code to test and perfect their SEO skills. This is what learning is about!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">&nbsp;As an online educator, there are so many small tasks that constantly need to be done: updating, posting, notifications, email – the list goes on!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can easily fill an afternoon with busy work and still feel behind. When do you find the time to engage with learners and keep innovating your content? Not to mention marketing and selling courses as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter automation. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/online-schooling/5-automations-that-are-revolutionizing-e-learning/articleshow/94526155.cms">Automation is a popular strategy in elearning</a>, as it helps cut down on tedious tasks like enrollment, notifications, and giving/removing access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the best ways to introduce automation is by using <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. Hailed as “easy automation for busy people,” Zapier moves info between your web apps automatically, so you can focus on your most important work.&nbsp;Zapier uses a workflow called “Zaps” that connects your apps to automate repetitive tasks. A <em>trigger</em> is an event that starts a Zap, and an <em>action</em> is an event a Zap performs. The easy way to think of it is: “When this happens, do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to learn more? Let’s explore how to set up automations and best practices to keep your automations running smoothly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-set-up-automations-with-learndash-and-zapier">How to Set Up Automations with LearnDash and Zapier</h2>



<p>To connect LearnDash-related activities to Zapier, all you need is our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/zapier-integration/">free Zapier add-on</a>. Once installed, you have literally hundreds of apps available to connect to for your online courses. This is perfect if you are already using some of these tools for your business and want to integrate your LearnDash courses into them.</p>



<p>There are several triggers and actions around your LearnDash site that can trigger a zap. Here are a few of the supported triggers:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A learner enrolls in or completes a course</li>



<li>A learner is added to a new group or leaves a group</li>



<li>An essay or assignment is submitted</li>



<li>A Lesson, Quiz, or Topic is completed</li>



<li>A user completes all courses in one group</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-tips-for-successful-elearning-automation">Tips for successful eLearning automation</h2>



<p>To get the most out of your automation, you should plan your Zaps out first. Think about what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish and break down the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. Ask:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>What apps do I want to use? (LearnDash and Mailchimp, for example)&nbsp;</li>



<li>What event will trigger my Zap? (a new learner enrolls)&nbsp;</li>



<li>What event will my Zap perform?&nbsp; (a welcome email is automatically sent)&nbsp;</li>



<li>What information do I want to move between those apps? (The contact’s name, email address, and the course name).</li>
</ul>



<p>Zapier keeps track of all the tasks your Zaps attempt. You can see which tasks were successful and unsuccessful. To maintain your automation, here are a few best practices to follow:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>After making any changes, test the automation with sample data to ensure it is still working as expected.</li>



<li>Document any changes or updates made to the automation for future reference.</li>



<li>Keep the automation simple and only include the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome.</li>



<li>Keep an eye on the usage and performance of the automation to identify and address any potential bottlenecks.</li>



<li>Use<a href="https://platform.zapier.com/docs/versions"> version control</a> if needed for your Zaps to have a clear change log and roll back if necessary.</li>



<li>Use Multi-Step Zaps to split a complex Zap into smaller, more manageable parts.</li>



<li>Keep an eye on the usage limits of your apps to avoid hitting the limit and breaking the zaps.</li>
</ol>
